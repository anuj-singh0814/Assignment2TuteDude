This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts.

Programs Included
1.** Sum of Integers from 1 to 50**
This program calculates the sum of all integers between 1 and 50 using two different approaches:

Using a for loop to iterate through the range and accumulate the sum

Using Python's built-in sum() function with range()

2.** Even or Odd Number Checker**
This program checks whether a user-input number is even or odd using the modulus operator (%).
